# Prototyping

## Prototypes

What is a Prototype?

* In other fields: a small-scale model that communicates design
* An interaction design: A model of a user interface, e.g.,
  * a series of screen sketches
  * a storyboard
  * a powerpoint slide show
  * a video simulating the use of a system
  * a cardboard mock-up
  * a piece of software with limited functionality

Why create a prototype?

* Fundamental tenet of user-centered design: *involve users early and often*
* A prototype is much easier to create than an actual implementation, and takes far less time
* A prototype *communicates* design and encourages *feedback*
  * A user study with a prototype can provide designers with valuable feedback, even if the prototype isn't fully functional
  * People are more likely to give feedback on "rough, unpolished" sketches
* Designers can get answers to specific *research questions* reguarding a design
  * Of several design alternatives, which is better?
  * Will a given design work? If not, how can we fix it?
  * What will users expect in certain interaction scenarios?
* Stakeholders can see, hold, interact with an emerging design before it is fully implemented

## Low-Fidelity prototype

* User "art supplies"
* Can also be implemented on computer with, e.g., Pencil Project, Balsamig
* Are quick, cheap and easily changed

## High-Fidelity prototype

* Use materials that users would expect to be used for the final project
* Look more like final system than a low-fidelity version
* Possible Danger: Users will think they have a full system, and then be disappointed
* Common high-fidelity prototyping environments include Adobe CD, .NET, and PHP
