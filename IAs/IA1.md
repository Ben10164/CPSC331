## Bad Design

|*This image shows the new redesign of Zagweb.*|

The reason this interface is bad is because it overwhelms the user. The majority of the time, a studnet is going on Zagweb to view thier student profile, which is now much lower on the page, and much smaller than other options. The Student Profile page is much smaller than other options such as "Zagcard & Bulldog Bucks", which takes up and entire section.

Another reason this interface is bad is because the spaces in links are not underlined. This makes it seem as if "Student", "Profile" and "page" are separate links the user can click.

## Good Design

This light switch is an example of good design because it fixes the problems plagued by other types of multi-controlled lightswitches. Whereas other designs use an "up-down" way to toggle the lightswitch, this design uses a single button press. This button press has an LED light that signifies the current state of the light, fixing one issue with lights that have multiple switches.

## Augmented Design

This is an augmented design because someone added a label to the phone that informs the user on what the number of the phone is.
