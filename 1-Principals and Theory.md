## Lecture #01

### Why is software hard to design?

* Difficult to use (poor usability)
* Doesn't support the functionality that people actually need (not useful)
* Hard to get requirements right
* Hard to translate requirements into *usable* and *useful* software
* Human behavior is difficult to predict
  * no exact method
  * impossible to anticipate all possible conditions of use
* "Time is money"

### Why is this bad?

* Decreased sales
* dissatisfied customers/negative perceptions
* poor reviews
* increased need to for training

### How can we create better designed products

* Design is Not and Exact Science
* Experience + Methodology + Aesthetics = Good Design
* Human or User centered development
  * Guided by empirical studies wit actual users
  * users incorporated into the design process early on
  * users sometimes even join design team

### The key goals of Human Computer Interactions

* To develop and refine theories and principles of human computer use and human-computer communication
* to develop techniques and practices for designing and developing human usable software

### User-Centered Design Process

### User Experience Requirements

* Establish human subjective experience goals in **observable, measurable terms**

## Lecture #02

### Affordance

* Relationship between a person and an object that suggests what can be done with object
* Relationship between interacting agent (usually a person) and an object
* Affordances are NOT a property
* Must be perceivable
  * (SIGNIFIER) placing dots of super clean glass, making it less likely to be perceived as something to be passed through!

### Signifier

* A marking, label, or other indication that describes where the action should take place (labels, markers, sounds, etc)
* Accidental Signifiers
  * a bookmark intended for saving a spot in a book can also be used to gauge how much of the book is left

### Mapping

* It is the relationship between a set of controls and the items they control
* the relationship between a control and the action it produces
* Think of "Key Mapping"
  * you map the key (control) of an action (in-game action)
* Can also be physical, think of "thumbs up"

### Examples of previous three

* A stove with knobs:
  * The burners can be turned on (Affordance).
  * You know what knob to use because the diagram (Signifiers).
  * The knobs turn on the burners (map).

### Feedback

* Sending information back to the user about what has been done
* Includes sound, tactile, and visual feedback
* Feedback should
  * be immediate (people get frustrated quickly)
  * be prioritized (a cacophony doesn't help)
  * not be too little or too much
  * help the user know whether progress toward goal has been made
  * be relevant

### Conceptual Model

* A description, usually simplified, of how a device works
