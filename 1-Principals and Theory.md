## Week 1

### Why is software hard to design?

- Difficult to use (poor usability)
- Doesn't support the functionality that people actually need (not useful)
- Hard to get requirements right
- Hard to translate requirements into *usable* and *useful* software
- Human behavior is difficult to predict
  - no exact method
  - impossible to anticipate all possible conditions of use
- "Time is money"

### Why is this bad?

- Decreased sales
- dissatisfied customers/negative perceptions
- poor reviews
- increased need to for training

### How can we create better designed products

- Design is Not and Exact Science
- Experience + Methodology + Aesthetics = Good Design
- Human or User centered development
  - Guided by empirical studies wit actual users
  - users incorporated into the design process early on
  - users sometimes even join design team

### The key goals of Human Computer Interactions

- To develop and refine theories and principles of human computer use and human-computer communication
- to develop techniques and practices for designing and developing human usable software

### User-Centered Design Process

### User Experience Requirements

- Establish human subjective experience goals in __observable, measurable terms__

### Affordances

- Affordances are NOT objects
