## Lecture #01

### Why is software hard to design?

* Difficult to use (poor usability)
* Doesn't support the functionality that people actually need (not useful)
* Hard to get requirements right
* Hard to translate requirements into *usable* and *useful* software
* Human behavior is difficult to predict
  * no exact method
  * impossible to anticipate all possible conditions of use
* "Time is money"

### Why is this bad?

* Decreased sales
* dissatisfied customers/negative perceptions
* poor reviews
* increased need to for training

### How can we create better designed products

* Design is Not and Exact Science
* Experience + Methodology + Aesthetics = Good Design
* Human or User centered development
  * Guided by empirical studies wit actual users
  * users incorporated into the design process early on
  * users sometimes even join design team

### The key goals of Human Computer Interactions

1. To develop and refine theories and principles of human computer use and human-computer communication
1. to develop techniques and practices for designing and developing human usable software

### User-Centered Design Process

### User Experience Requirements

Establish human subjective experience goals in **observable, measurable terms**

## Lecture #02

### Affordance

Relationship between a person and an object that suggests what can be done with object

* Relationship between interacting agent (usually a person) and an object
* Affordances are NOT a property
* Must be perceivable
  * (SIGNIFIER) placing dots of super clean glass, making it less likely to be perceived as something to be passed through!

### Signifier

A marking, label, or other indication that describes where the action should take place (labels, markers, sounds, etc)

* Accidental Signifiers
  * a bookmark intended for saving a spot in a book can also be used to gauge how much of the book is left

### Mapping

It is the relationship between a set of controls and the items they control

* the relationship between a control and the action it produces
* Think of "Key Mapping"
  * you map the key (control) of an action (in-game action)
* Can also be physical, think of "thumbs up"

### Examples of previous three

* A stove with knobs:
  * The burners can be turned on (Affordance).
  * You know what knob to use because the diagram (Signifiers).
  * The knobs turn on the burners (map).

### Feedback

Sending information back to the user about what has been done

* Includes sound, tactile, and visual feedback
* Feedback should
  * be immediate (people get frustrated quickly)
  * be prioritized (a cacophony doesn't help)
  * not be too little or too much
  * help the user know whether progress toward goal has been made
  * be relevant

## Lecture #03

### Conceptual Model

![Conceptual Model](Images/Conceptual%20Model.png)

A description, usually simplified, of how a device works

* How do you view the interaction of an interface
  * the conceptual model of the thermostate
* Has three parts:
  1. Designer's Model
     * Designer Implements design model in system image
  2. User's Model
     * User Model determines what's understood
  3. System
  * System Image conveys design model to user
* This can cause some issues if the user does not have the same conceptual model as the designers

### Constraints

Perceived limitations of the actions that are possible with an object based on object's appearance

* A constrant is a limitation of usage
* Toggle switches are constrained to be on or off
* It's purpose is to limit the amount of incorrect options they can do

Types of Constraints:

1. Physical - A physical limitation (USB type)
2. Cultural - Allowable actions in social situations
   * Can be universal or culturally specific
   * can change over time
     * Face forward in elevator
3. Semantic - A limitation based on the interpretation or meaning (icons/symbols)
4. Logical - What is left over when all other actions are exhausted

Others:

* Cultural Norms, Conventions, Standards
  * Greetings, Flashing headlights, etc.
  * On Light Switches in the US are up, while in the UK they are down
  * These can be addressed in internatonal standards
* Transfer Effects: **Prior experience influencing how we expect to use/interact with an object**
  * MS Word Ribbons when converting to a new system
* Visibility
  * Elevator only showing possible actions
  * Suffers when there are too many interactions and not enough controls
